# Decorators

> Decorators make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at design time.
>
> While ES5 object literals support arbitrary expressions in the value position, ES6 classes
> only support literal functions as values. Decorators restore the ability to run code at
> design time, while maintaining a declarative syntax.
